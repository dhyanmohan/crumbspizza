            <p>Take-Out Pizza, Inc. will offer a wide variety of New York-style pizza, as well as sauces,
              sodas, fruit juices, and desserts.
              
              According to wikipedia.com, New York-style pizza originated in Manhattan, NY in the
              early 1900s. It is an American-style pizza which closely resembles that of Naples, Italy.
              This type of pizza is known to have thin, wide, and foldable slices. The toppings include
              tomato juice and mozzarella cheese. Additional toppings are placed on the cheese part
              of the pizza.
              
              Typically, the New York-style pizza is hand-tossed, light-sauced, and the slices are
              often eaten folded in half, as street snacks. It differentiates itself from other American
              pizza by its specific crust, made of high-gluten bread flour with distinguished flavor.
              
              The pizza is sold by the slice or as whole pies. The slices, taken from a large pizza,
              which is about 18 inches in diameter, are cut into 8 slices. When sold by the slice, we
              can offer both "regular" or "plain" pizza, and with different toppings. We will always keep
              plain items on hand, and will be able to provide our customers with various toppings,
              just by adding them on, prior to consumption or re-heating.
              
              The New York-style pizza is served with condiments such as red chili pepper, oregano,
              Parmesan cheese, or garlic powder, available for the customer to place on top of the
              slice. In addition to pizza, we offer other menu items, such as cookie dough, soft drinks,
              and dessert items.
              
              Pizza is served at the counter, for take-out, or delivered to the location indicated in our
              customer orders. We take orders online, by phone, or at our location.
              
              For delivery we offer 18-inch plain pies. The slices are sealed and the packaging will
              allow our customers to remove individual slices from their freezers as they need them.
              The pies are also shipped in leak-proof refrigerant gel packs. Thus, the customer will be
              able to pop them into a preheated oven (re-heat instructions are included in the
              package), or deep-six them for later use. The pizza can be delivered not only
              refrigerated, but also hot, depending on customer preference</p>
